       "'PRESS RELEASE. Dover, DE, USA, May8, 2024 — ChainGPT, the AI-powered Web3 infrastructure providing a diverse suite of tools and services, will exclusively launch the IDO of its latest launchpad project, Engines of Fury: a free-to-play top-down extraction shooter designed for Web3. Developed by talents from AAA titles, Blizzard, Activision, Ubisoft, and Unity, its top-down characteristic makes it a first within Web3&#8217;s free-to-play shooter arena. Set for May 8, Engines of Fury’s IDO leverages ChainGPT Pad’s acceleration program enabling the game to perfect its product systems, action plans, and roadmaps while receiving expert marketing and promotional support. As a premier decentralized fundraising and incubation platform for Web3 projects of all types, the ChainGPT Pad has been recognized as the most popular launchpad of 2023. The incubation program promotes emerging startups strategically hand-picked by ChainGPT based on their disruptive potential, transforming their ideas into viable business solutions. The program extensively assists in product development, smart contract implementation, and user engagement. Through expert mentorship and access to an extensive network of influential partners and investors, the ChainGPT Pad’s incubation provides Web3 startups the tools to navigate inevitable challenges and thrive. Engines of Fury immerses players in a dystopian world ravaged by a mutagenic virus from a meteor. Gamers navigate a perilous universe—scavenging for resources, enhancing hideouts, and upgrading gear while honing their abilities through single-player and cooperative modes. With a robust in-game economy driven by its native $FURY token, the game emphasizes a journey of survival, craftsmanship, and community. Engines of Fury’s goal is to create a game that introduces mainstream players to the distinct advantages of blockchain, without forcing Web3 elements into core aspects of gameplay. Making it simple for all players to jump into the game, Engines of Fury’s crypto aspects serve as a bonus, not a must. The game includes classic gaming elements with an easy onboarding process for non-crypto natives, with features such as: NFT Mining and Trading: Players discover resources and forge unique NFTS to enhance their character&#8217;s abilities and appearance. Gamers can trade these NFTs freely on the Engines of Fury marketplace and other compatible platforms. Play-And-Earn Mechanics: Players can earn in-game virtual currency that can potentially convert to real-world income. Earned crypto assets and NFTs remain fully under the player’s ownership. Skill-Based Rewards: Top players earn $FURY tokens based on leaderboard rankings, achievements, and in-game activities. Council Crates: Special, limited-quantity NFTs will be available during the Engine of Fury NFT Presale event. Cross-Game Interoperability: Engines of Fury collaborates with exciting projects to enable asset interoperability, expanding gameplay possibilities and community engagement. With an overwhelming response, Engines of Fury attracted over 80,000 applications for its Private Alpha Test, extending the game’s original playtest deadline. The enthusiasm following the private alpha test underscores the demand for high-quality Web3 gaming experiences. Engines of Fury IDO information: Token price: $.20 IDO date: May 13th Token ticker: $FURY Allocation size: 250,00 Max supply: 120,000,000 Network: Binance Smart Chain IMC (without liquidity): $416,667 IMC (with liquidity): $1,376,667 Circulating supply at TGE: 6,883,333 Fully Diluted Valuation at TGE: $24 million Vesting schedule: 15 percent TGE, 2-month cliff, 12 months linear vesting “It has been a pleasure collaborating with Engines of Fury, who brilliantly blend blockchain-based assets with a high-quality and engaging gaming experience,” says Ilan Rakhmanov, CEO and Founder of ChainGPT. “Engines of Fury exemplifies the unique and inclusive gaming experiences that resonate with a global audience. Their IDO represented an exciting opportunity for the community to support pioneering projects that reshape the gaming landscape for more than 3.3 billion players worldwide.” “With the help of ChainGPT, we’ve crafted a game that serves as a prime example of how gamers and developers can collaborate to build immersive experiences that rival traditional gaming structures,” says Saulius Aleksa, Co-Founder and CEO of Engines of Fury. We are grateful for the collaboration with the talented team at ChainGPT, whose expertise and invaluable guidance have been instrumental throughout the development of our game.” About ChainGPT: ChainGPT is the leading provider of AI-powered infrastructure for crypto, blockchain, and Web3. From a next-generation IDO launchpad and incubator to automated smart contract generation and auditing as well as an advanced Web3 AI chatbot to AI-powered news aggregation, an AI training assistant, cross-chain swap, and an NFT generator, ChainGPT is a sophisticated, end-to-end solution for AI Web3 infrastructure. By integrating large language models (LLM) with blockchain, the company builds advanced, accessible, and user-friendly tools for all users.

The game is a free-to-play top-down extraction shooter that combines the thrill of player versus player (PVP) and player versus environment (PVE) gameplay. Engine of Fury incorporates non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into its gameplay, allowing players to own unique digital assets that can be used within the game. These NFTs include unique weapons, armor, and champions that players can use in battle. The game’s deflationary token, $FURY, is used for various in-game actions, including participating in arenas and forging new NFTs.

Ulbricht&#x2019;s counsel began the trial on an interesting note, arguing that Ulbricht indeed founded the site, but that he was not the Dread Pirate Roberts, the mysterious operator of the online free marketplace. In a cross-examination of DHS agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan on the third day of the trial, Ulbricht&#x2019;s defense team coaxed a serious shocker from the agent who had infiltrated the Silk Road as an employee: &#x201C;You believed him to be the mastermind behind Silk Road, keeping it secure and operating?&#x201D; Ulbricht defense attorney Dratel asked Der-Yeghiayan. &#x201C;I did,&#x201D; Der-Yeghiayan testified. But he wasn&#x2019;t talking about Ulbricht. He was talking about former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, who is involved in a legal battle of his own regarding the hundreds of thousands of bitcoins that went missing from his site in the beginning of 2014. &#x201C;The Homeland Security agent&#x2019;s theory was that Karpeles, as owner of Mt. Gox, held an enormous amount of Bitcoin. He used Silk Road to leverage that price and raise it, which it did by several hundred times over during the course of Silk Road&#x2019;s lifespan. Bitcoin was worth around $2 at Silk Road&#x2019;s launch and hit as high as $290 by 2013.&#x201D; If it turns out to be true, this is the plot twist of the century! + Mark Karpeles issued a statement denying that he is the Dread Pirate Roberts. + A first-hand account from someone in the courtroom on day 3. ENCRYPTION Earlier this week, British PM David Cameron questioned the need for end-to-end encrypted communications, arguing that no one should have the right to communicate electronically in a way that the government can&#x2019;t access the contents. Cameron actually said, The question is, are we going to allow a means of communications which simply isn&#x2019;t possible to read? My answer to that question is: no, we must not. Wow. Consider for a moment the absurdity of a first-world, Western head of state slamming the use of one of the most essential technologies relied upon today. Chances are good that you are reading this over an HTTPS connection, which uses that pesky encryption thing, and so do apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and iMessage. Virtually all of your private data, your credit card numbers, bank statements, and medical records are all kept relatively safe online through the use of strong encryption techniques. Cameron&#x2019;s remarks were immediately condemned by people all around the world.Free speech activists, newspapers, internet security experts, and just plain oldregular folks the world over were flabbergasted by the fact that, again, the leader of a western democracy suggested making private digital communications impossible. After two days of meetings with Cameron, Barack Obama then alsovoiced his concerns about encryption. &#x201C;If we find evidence of a terrorist plot&#x2026; and despite having a phone number, despite having a social media address or email address, we can&#x2019;t penetrate that, that&#x2019;s a problem,&#x201D; Obama said. He said he believes Silicon Valley companies also want to solve the problem. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re patriots.&#x201D; Wait, what? The United States was founded on the principle that a government&#x2019;s power should be restricted in order to avoid tyranny. The right to private communications is a fundamental one; it&#x2019;s the reason why it&#x2019;s a felony to open someone else&#x2019;s mail, and why the government needs a warrant to do so. The patriotic thing to do probably doesn&#x2019;t involve violating the United States constitution. Former NSA lawyer Stewart Baker had this to say: &#x201C;We expect companies to be able to help with this. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that you always have to write bad cryptography.&#x201D;&#xA0; Cryptography with a backdoor is bad cryptography, full stop. What happens when the backdoor key inevitably falls into the wrong hands? Granting the government unrestricted access to private communications does not make anyone safer &#x2014; it in fact does just the opposite. To concentrate so much power in the authority of a government is just inviting abuses of the system. McCarthy-era blacklists were scary enough without government having the ability to algorithmically sort and discover anyone who says something they don&#x2019;t like. A populace that self-censors itself for a fear of their speech getting them in trouble can no longer be said to have free speech. Living in China, I know just how excruciating dealing with an unfree internet is. It&#x2019;s one of the worst parts about living here. Only by using strong cryptography am I able to bypass the censorship at all, even to do the simplest of things like checking my email. If China had a way to backdoor VPNs, which rely on strong encryption, they&#x2019;d still be able to stop me from looking at Gmail. It will be a very, very sad day for freedom when the US is taking cues from China on internet policy. I am deeply concerned about Cameron and Obama&#x2019;s remarks this week. + Cory Doctorow explains how stupid the idea of putting government backdoors in everything is. + The Digital Arms Race: NSA Preps America for Future Battle &#x2013; Der Spiegel published new Snowden docs. VOLATILITY I don&#x2019;t typically focus on the price of bitcoin in this newsletter, because I believe that the price is one of the least important things about this whole bitcoin thing, and it&#x2019;s very difficult to know all the forces at work during any big price movement. That said, this week&#x2019;s ~30% downswing is notable, because there hasn&#x2019;t been this much volatility for nearly a year, and also the price is at an 18 month low. Some miners are turning off their machines as lower coin prices means they are no longer profitable. Wired writer Jerry Brito also thinks that &#x201C;The Price of Bitcoin Doesn&#x2019;t Matter Right Now&#x201D;: &#x201C;In other words, it&#x2019;s early days. The Googles and Facebooks of Bitcoin&#x2013;the killer apps that will make the technology indispensable for ordinary users&#x2013;may not come for another 5 years. Unlike the early Web, though, Bitcoin has a price ticker people look at daily, and so they wring their hands. Every dip and spike in the price gets a lot of attention and spells either doom or &#x201C;irrational exuberance.&#x201D; But as Marc Andreessen has pointed out, &#x201C;the price of domain names didn&#x2019;t determine the usefulness of the Internet.&#x201D; Bitcoin wasn&#x2019;t the only thing to see crazy volatility this week: The Swiss National Bank lifted an artificial cap on the Franc which had pegged it at the rate of 1.2 Euros. Within minutes of removing the peg, the value of the CHF had skyrocketed 30%, up to 0.805 EUR per, before coming back to rest at about 13% higher than before, at 1.04 EUR per CHF. The Euro itself continues to lose value against the USD. It&#x2019;s down around 15% in the last six months, and is moving closer towards parity with the US dollar. Chart BITS & PIECES IBM ADEPT: a blockchain-based proof of concept for a potential &#x201C;internet of things&#x201D; infrastructure.
